# Feed-forward-neural-network
This project involves training a feed-forward neural network with 3 hidden layers each with 64 neurons. The neural network will be trained to accurately classify images of fashion items into 10 different classes. The images used for training will be sourced from the Fashion MNIST dataset.The input to the network will consist of 28 Ã— 28-pixel images, while the output will be a real number. Through this project, the aim is to successfully develop and implement a powerful neural network that can accurately classify fashion item images with high precision.
